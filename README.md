# Resume Analyzer

## Overview
Resume Analyzer is a Python program designed to process and analyze resume data. The project is set up for further development and does not yet contain executable analysis logic.

## Installation

### Requirements
Python 3.8 or later is required. To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Sources
The program uses external CSV files hosted on GitHub for resume data. These files are:
- **Data2.csv** (original resumes)
- **Labeled_Resumes.csv** (labeled resume data)
- **Recommendation.csv** (resume recommendations)

## Project Structure
- **FirstPhase/**: Scripts and data for the initial phase of processing.
- **SecondPhase/**: Scripts and data for the subsequent phase of processing.
- **labeled_data/**, **labeled_data_1/**: Directories containing labeled datasets.
- **Test/**: Contains test scripts or data.

## Usage
Currently, the `main.py` script serves as a template. WE need to implement the processing logic.

## Contributing
Contributions to the development of Resume Analyzer are welcome.
